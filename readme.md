# RatingLog

RatingLog is a upcoming open source chromium extension that helps raters (TELUS, WeLocalize, Reforma, etc) with tracking their work hours prior to imputing them into Workday or other platforms. The tool can also be used by freelancers who want to store their start and stop times. 

The project is currently under active development towards our alpha launch. Further information will be available prior to the launch of the alpha version of our product on the Chrome store. In addition, this project will begin accepting open source contributions when the alpha version is released.
