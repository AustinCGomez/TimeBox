# RatingLog

[!CAUTION] ***This program is currently in pre-alpha active development with changes happening frequently to the code base. We do not recommend using the tool to log your hours till we release our alpha version in the coming days. There is a risk that your hours will not save or unexpected errors might ensue. Please only use this program for development till the maintainers release the polished and tested version.***

RatingLog is a Chrome extension that allows raters (TELUS, Welocalize, Reforma, etc.) to keep track of their work hours prior to inputting them into Workday or other platforms. We made this tool as a quick place to log your hours as we found it can often be cumbersome to log into the Workday platforms and enter the hours when the hours can be fairly inconsistent.

## Downloading production-ready extension
Coming soon! Our team is still working on a few components to the extension before publishing it on the sotre. We want to ensure that it is error-free. 

## Building from source
1. You need to install the source files to your system from this repo or your fork of this repo. You can achieve this through git or by downloading a zip of the files. 
2. Next, open up Chrome, and navigate to chrome://extensions and look for a tab that says 'Load unpacked'. 
3. Once you find 'Load unpacked', you will then need to click on it and find the folder with the source code. Load in that folder and then click where your extensions are located. 
4. Done! Any changes that you make now will be reflected in the extension. You can also find errors within chrome://extensions that will help you when troubleshooting.
