## Installation
___Due to the fact that this application is under development we are only confident to release it as a unpackaged extension. You can follow the instructions below to have the application running as an unofficial extension in your Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser.__

### Installation instructions for Google Chrome: 
Step one: Install the source files to your local system through git or the zip file. 
Step two: Open your Google Chrome and type 'chrome://extensions' in your web browser which redirects you to where all your extensions are located. 
Step three: Enable developer mode and then locate 'Load unpackaged'. You will then need to find the folder with your source code and hit select. 
Step four: Timebox should not pop up as a extension and you are now all set to begin using it! 

### Installation instructions for Microsoft Edge: 
Step one: Install the source files to your local system through git or the zip file. 
Step two: Open your Microsoft Edge browser and on the upper right side find the extensions icon and click **manage extensions**. 
Step three: Make sure that you enable **developer mode** and you will then see **Load unpackaged**. 
Step four: Click on **Load unpackaged** and then find your source folder and click add. Timelog is now ready to be used on your local browser.
