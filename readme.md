# About us 
Timebox is a plugin for Google Chrome [Pending Approval] that allows freelancers the ability to keep track of their hours worked on a week to week basis. 

# Building from Source

1. You need to install the source files to your system from this repo or your fork of this repo. You can achieve this through git or by downloading a zip of the files. 
2. Next, open up Chrome, and navigate to chrome://extensions and look for a tab that says 'Load unpacked'. 
3. Once you find 'Load unpacked', you will then need to click on it and find the folder with the source code. Load in that folder and then click where your extensions are located. 
4. Done! Any changes that you make now will be reflected in the extension. You can also find errors within chrome://extensions that will help you when troubleshooting.
