# RaterLog

RaterLog is a free chrome extension that helps raters (TELUS, Welocalize, Reforma, etc, etc) accurately keep track of their work hours when rating tasks. The extension can also be used by freelancers who are logging hours for their work tasks for clients. 

The project is currently under active development and further information will be available as soon as a alpha version is deployed to the Chrome market.
